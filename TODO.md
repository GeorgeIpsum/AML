# General

* configure mobx-state-tree models
* set up firebase auth
  * move environment related materials to rootStore model
* make generic api class and extend basic stuff from there
* change all of these css class names to not be silly and randomly capitalized
* combine deposit and deposit-list-store folder structure
* have nav items be dynamically generated and passed through App.tsx's navItems class prop. don't create navItems in rootComponent bc that sucks
* move themeing stuff to styles.scss as opposed to fixing in App.scss
* find some funky fresh bg art to pepper onto that bad boy (App-inner/ rootcompnent)
