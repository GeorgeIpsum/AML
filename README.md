## getting-things-done-as-a-~~service~~-react-app

GTD‚Äîor ‚ÄúGetting things done‚Äù‚Äîis a framework for organizing and tracking your tasks and projects. Its aim is a bit higher than just ‚Äúgetting things done‚Äù, though. (It should have been called ‚ÄúGetting things done in a much better way than just letting things happen, which often turns out not to be very cool at all‚Äù.) Its aim is to make you have 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects‚Äîboth vague things like ‚Äúinvent greatest thing ever‚Äù and concrete things like ‚Äúcall Yaseen on October 14 to discuss genoise sponge‚Äù. Everything!

A typical GTD workflow will look like this:
